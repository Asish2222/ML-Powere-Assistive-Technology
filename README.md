# Emotion Recognition for Autism Support  
### A Multi-Modal Machine Learning Approach

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on supporting individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) by recognizing human emotions using a **multi-modal machine learning system**.  
The system analyzes inputs such as **facial expressions, voice signals, and text/speech data** to identify emotions and provide meaningful feedback that can help improve social interaction and emotional understanding.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect human emotions accurately using multiple data sources  
- Assist individuals with autism in understanding emotions better  
- Reduce dependency on single-modal emotion recognition systems  
- Improve real-world applicability and reliability  

---

## 🧠 Key Features
- Multi-modal emotion recognition (Face, Voice, Text)
- Machine learning–based emotion classification
- Real-time or near real-time analysis
- Scalable and modular system architecture
- Autism-friendly assistive application concept

## 🏗️ System Architecture
The system works in the following stages:

1. **Input Acquisition**
   - Facial images / video
   - Voice or speech audio
   - Text (optional)

2. **Preprocessing**
   - Face detection and normalization
   - Audio noise reduction and feature extraction
   - Text cleaning and tokenization

3. **Feature Extraction**
   - CNN for facial features
   - MFCCs for audio signals
   - NLP embeddings for text data

4. **Model Training & Fusion**
   - Individual emotion classifiers
   - Multi-modal feature fusion
   - Final emotion prediction

5. **Output**
   - Detected emotion
   - Visual or textual feedback
